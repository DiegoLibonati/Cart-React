## Description

I made a web application that simulates a shopping cart. Basically we will have different types of cell phones, each one of these cell phones will have a price as we add more, the total price will be added and also the amount of products in the cart will be added. If we touch `Clear cart` we will eliminate all the items in the cart. Use useReducer.
